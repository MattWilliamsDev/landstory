					<p>Landstory is a group of unique professionals. According to our clients
						we "just feel right". You can read their testimonials or the abridged edition
						of their descriptors of us including "comfortable, fun, energetic, passionate,
						open, positive, engaging". </p>
					<p> We work hard, we have fun along the way and we help build consensus
						even in contentious environments. Our creative philosophy believes that
						less is more and we always have an end in sight. We are driven and guided
						by "the story."  Combining our extensive planning, design and technical
						expertise and proven public involvement process, we get results.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Teaming</dt>
				<dd>
					<p> The answer to one question guides us in our work with our consultants...  "what
						does the client and the project need?"  We are very comfortable working
						as a sub-consultant or as the lead consultant. We are comfortable working
						with others who share our commitment to the client and to the project and
						who continually understand and work toward the goal. We understand the
						opportunity of hard work, and what it takes to keep the client coming back.
						As a result, we align ourselves very carefully with only those who do exceptional
						work and share our teaming approach.</p>
