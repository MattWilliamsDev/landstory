				Located in one of the oldest residential neighborhoods in Indianapolis, Brookside and Spades Parks are connected and located on the near east-side of Indianapolis .  Rolling, forested topography grace these two parks offering a variety of passive and active recreation activities.  Our favorite part of the project was successfully saving a small, historic footbridge; one of the last character-setting remnants of the parks' history.     Landstory was able to demonstrate the potential cost savings of retaining and restoring the bridge, vs. the cost of demolition, hauling and replacement.  Restoration of the new bridge left enough budget to add trails, play equipment and improved parking.  The plan served as the basis for other improvements including the renovation of the community center and the inclusion of a new water park.  A small but meaningful project, it led to improved visibility of both parks and renewed development interest.
