				There are not many cities in the U.S. that can boast having a state park right smack in the center of their downtown.  But Indianapolis can.  As a consultant to a national landscape architecture firm, Landstory contributed by bringing a local understanding and vision to the planning effort.   Our role was to make sure the values, the public vision and the local history were understood and appropriately translated as part of the Master Plan recommendations. The two initial site visits by the consultant team involved canoeing the White River and a subsequent bicycle trip from the Indianapolis Museum of Art to downtown, in a snow storm along the canal tow-path.  Still donâ€™t know who to blame for that, but it allowed us to view the study area from a unique perspective and broaden our understanding about the unique qualities of the White River and historic canal system.  Landstory was also responsible for the design and development of a number of details as part of the implementation including the canal walls, seating, lighting and landscape design.  In addition to all we learned about the White River and the tow-path, we also learned riding bicycles in the snow is not for the weak of heart.
