			<p class="storyline"> In 2008, the city of Evansville hired Landstory to complete their 2009 â€“2013 Parks, Recreation and Open Space Master Plan.   Project Manager Doug Decker jumped at the opportunity to return to his old stomping grounds and lead the project.  With over 65 parks totaling 2,300 acres, the planning team completed a comprehensive needs assessment / inventory and analysis.  Armed with digital cameras, base maps, and rental cars, the team members set out on a two day site reconnaissance mission.  Combining the in-depth research, numerous public input sessions, stakeholder meetings and city council reviews, the 5-year master plan was prepared, providing the city with a unique and visionary parks and recreation action plan.</p>
