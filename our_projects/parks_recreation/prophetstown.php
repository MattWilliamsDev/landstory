				The first state park site selected in Indiana in a number of decades, Prophetstown combined many stories; told through the layout of the circulation system and development of a new design vocabulary.  Landstory's first site visit was highlighted by an initial helicopter ride.  A first for sure, we nervously donned the necessary equipment, faced our fears and enjoyed the ride.  IDNR requested the design elements differ from their other parks, which consisted mostly of designed elements dating back to the WPA.  Central to our approach, we proposed use of indigenous, natural materials in contemporary form and design. Landstory researched the area's history, interviewed the family of a Native American chief and assisted IDNR with the development of a phased, implementation program.  Forms, colors, textures and the unique stamp of the tribes native to the area were integrated into the guardhouse, cabins, picnic structures, signage, walls, bridges and landscaping.  We still prefer site visits on-foot however.
