					Cancer affects all of our lives, directly and indirectly.  For us it meant bringing awareness, meaning and a sense of optimism to this devastating disease.  The public art pieces and the surrounding landscape serve as a public reminder.  On the corner of the site sits a five foot onyx sphere, gently encased in two concrete ribbons, symbolizing the nurturing of a healthy cell, symbolizing hope.  Sustainable solutions included 75,000 square feet of green roof packed with plants native to Indiana mitigating the negative impacts of surface storm drainage.  It was all about green. NOT that it’s Joann’s last name.  That just worked out that way.  But it is about her passion, commitment to her clients, the profession and the critical contributions of a very special staff.  And two awards for Landstory in 2008 and 2009.  Icing on the cake.
