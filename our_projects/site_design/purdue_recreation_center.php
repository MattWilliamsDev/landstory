				As a student at Purdue from 1973 to 1977, Joann spent many hours playing racquetball at this facility; donning her knee-high striped sport socks, her boilermaker jersies, Farah Fawcett hair and 70's style gym shorts.  (this could prove to be embarrassing.)   Nonetheless she returned to campus as owner of Landstory, donned in more fashionable attire, to assist with the site design for the planned remodel of this major campus facility. A reoriented main entrance, a new drop-off, parking area and connection to a new interior sports building,  tree lined streets and sustainable site features bring this building into the present.  Bioswales, pervious pavement, sitting areas and public gathering spaces highlight this $98,000,000 project.  Boiler Up!!</p>
