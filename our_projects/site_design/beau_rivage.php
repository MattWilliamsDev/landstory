			<p class="storyline"> Mix one six month completion schedule with $450,000,000 in construction costs and you have a pretty amazing story.  Devastated by Hurricane Katrina, the Beau Rivage Casino and MGM Mirage was committed to being back in business in very short order.  Facing a challenging design completion schedule, Landstory completed the design in record time.  At the request of the owner, the construction documents phase was eliminated, so the new landscape was installed using the concept plans.  But through careful and strategic communications and constant on-site presence, we helped make it happen.  The delivery of 60,000 annuals arriving via barge was truly a sight to behold.  Over 60, 30'-tall evergreens were hand selected by Landstory from a variety of large nurseries in Mississippi and Alabama.  Overseeing the landscape and accent lighting installation in 100 degree heat and 98% humidity proved memorable. The casino re-opened one year to the day after Katrina played its devastating hand.  We are grateful for the opportunity to be a part of bringing hope to a region tragically undone.  </p>
