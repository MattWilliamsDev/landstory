				Four hotels and a giant ballroom structure.  Our focus became the public plaza along West Washington Street.  Formed by the façades of the JW Marriot, the Fairfield Inn and Springhill Suites, three important Indiana symbols dominate; Indiana’s state flower, tree and bird.   A forty foot, stylized red cardinal is placed prominently to one side. The cardinal and base is perched on a branch of our state tree, the Tulip Tree reflected in the decorative pavement.  Parallel to the street, facing the Fairfield Inn, is a segmented water wall depicting fields of our state flower, the peony.  The best view?  Seven floors up.  Check out the unique entrance to the JW. Plus, all the pavement joints are oriented to reinforce views of the adjacent, significant facilities including the Indiana State Office Building, the Eiteljorg Museum and White River State Park.  Fun stuff.
