				Anyone will tell you there are plenty of stories to be told along sixty miles of abandoned railroad corridor.  For Cardinal Greenway, Landstory incorporated an extensive interpretive signage component.  Several stories were told, educational facts shared, each in context to its location including a variety of headlines and pertinent local information including "Gone fishin'", a famous train wreck and talk of round barns long gone.  The combination of the interpretive education component and the unique trail design helped to garner Landstory a national award for Community Design by ASLA and the Rails-to-Trails Conservancy.  Happy trails, happy client happy Landstory.</p>
