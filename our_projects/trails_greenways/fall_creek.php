					The story here was a continuation of the other Indy Greenways trails and incorporated similar signage, materials and respect for the natural environment.     For this section, it was honoring the beauty and purpose of Fall Creek, a scenic, meandering waterway, and riparian corridor.  No other trail in Indianapolis offers anything as visually aesthetic or environmentally rich.  Customized seating double as chess boards.   Handicap accessible boat launches allow all to access and experience the creek and all its wonder. Small access areas offer parking and seating, mile-markers and other information.  Of significance is the opportunity it provides, bringing citizens of varying neighborhoods and cultures together... connecting.
