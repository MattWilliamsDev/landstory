				Founded in 1799, the City of Franklin was the site of one of the bloodiest battles in the Civil War.  Now a major tourist destination, Franklin has been dubbed the Los Angeles / Hollywood of the south and has some of the best country cookin' in the U.S.   Running with the thoughts of historic tourism, second-to-none hospitality and way of life, country music, and cookin', Landstory set out to develop a Greenways and Open Space Master Plan connecting all of these ideas.  Planning for development of a contiguous, functional, sustainable, recreational, educational open space and greenway network had its own unique set of challenges.  Utilizing the Harpeth River, scenic country roads and extensive public open space, Landstory developed a seamless greenway/trail system.
