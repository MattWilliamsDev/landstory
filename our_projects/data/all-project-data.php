Our focus became the public plaza along West Washington Street. The plaza formed by the facades of the JW Marriott, Fairfield Inn and Springhill Suites, incorporated three important Indiana state symbols; the flower, tree and bird. A forty foot stylized red cardinal, the state bird, overlooks the plaza perched on a decorative tulip branch, the state tree. The tulip tree is reflected in the decorative pavement surrounding the cardinal sculpture. Parallel to the street is a segmented water wall depicting fields of peonies, the state flower. But for the best view go seven floors up and check out the unique entrance to the JW Marriott where the forms of the surface pavement are oriented to reinforce views of significant facilities nearby, including the Indiana State Office Building, the Eiteljorg Museum and White River State Park."

Our role was to make sure the values, the public vision and the local history were understood and appropriately translated as part of the Master Plan recommendations.

Still don\'t know who to blame for that, but it allowed us to view the study area from a unique perspective and broaden our understanding about the unique qualities of the White River and historic canal system.  Landstory was also responsible for the design and development of a number of details as part of the implementation including the canal walls, seating, lighting and landscape design.

Flash forward just 5 years and abandoned Interlake had already become an established local hotspot for ORV users, hunters, fisherman, horseback riders, and trappers...just to name a few.  In 1999, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) purchased the +3500 acres from the Interlake Foundation.  Flash forward again 9 years and IDNR hires the Landstory team to prepare the master plan for this \'wild west-esque\' terrain.  Setting out on a 3 day, down and dirty survey of the land on quads and other ORVs, the Landstory team was able to experience the site from a unique perspective.   After careful inspection and environmental study of sweeping grassland, native forest and manmade lakes, the planning team developed a comprehensive master plan to provide IDNR with a plan for Interlake\'s future growth as a vital recreational destination."

Now a major tourist destination, Franklin has been dubbed the Los Angeles / Hollywood of the south. Running with the thoughts of historic tourism, second-to-none hospitality and way of life, country music, and amazing \'country-cookin\', Landstory set out to develop a Greenways and Open Space Master Plan connecting all of these ideas. Planning for development of a contiguous, functional, sustainable, recreational, educational open space and greenway network had its own unique set of challenges. Utilizing the Harpeth River, scenic country roads and extensive public open space, Landstory developed a seamless greenway/trail system."

Our process included site assessment and analysis, program definition, concept development and implementation strategies.</p><p><strong>Phase I Implementation:</strong><br>Funding became a reality so the Landstory team worked closely with the newly formed Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites to identify their implementation priorities. It certainly was not a shock to learn the first project was going to be improvements to Indiana\'s first courthouse and surrounding historic town square...all in time for the state bicentennial celebration in 2016!</p>"

As with many small remote towns, Cannelton fell victim to local commercial disinvestment as government services and industry left.

Because of our winning track record of working with small towns and cities around Indiana, Landstory was selected as part of the planning team to develop a plan for revitalizing their historic downtown. Analysis of existing conditions included identification of potential development opportunities, concept preparation, streetscape recommendations and an action plan. The proposed business district design concept and visual character featured a phased approach with preliminary budgets."

The town was once famous for its bricks but has since grown to a community of farmers, manufacturing but currently known as \"The Hub\" of Fountain County, due west of Indianapolis. Like many small towns in Indiana, Veedersburg wanted to rejuvenate their downtown business district with improvements focused on enhancing the community connectivity to local, regional and cultural assets. Landstory implemented a study focused on these goals. Existing abandoned rail lines, once the lifeline of manufacturing in the area, were emphasized for their connectivity potential. Community cultural and historical elements would be interpreted and highlighted by a Heritage Walk. And special attention was given to gateways into the town as a way to boost local and regional visibility of the rich history of Veedersburg."

The original, natural landscape of this region was a tall grass prairie.  Large public art pieces and customized ornamentation consisting of abstracted forms of the original prairie grasses were incorporated into the design of planters, seat walls and lighting.  Our market analysis led to the realization that commercial development in Urbana was saturated and a rental housing shortage existed.  This observation served to guide design decisions relative to land use (more residential), building massing (two-story) and landscape character (deeper setbacks allowing for more greenspace).  As we often find in our work, the right answer can sometimes be the most unexpected one."
