The creative, unique concept we developed for the streetscape and  2. The $1,000,000 in TE funding we helped the neighborhood secure.  One has to drive south on Emerson from I-70 to truly understand the existing diversity in scale, design and character along this major corridor in Indianapolis.  Proposed neighborhood entrances along Emerson Avenue, developed by Landstory, are flanked with customized masonry columns with three-dimensional elements designed to characterize the unique style and significant history of each neighborhood.  In addition, the Landstory team prepared a Transportation Enhancement application resulting in $1 million in funding...another service we are proud to offer to all of our clients.  \"Show them the money.\""
