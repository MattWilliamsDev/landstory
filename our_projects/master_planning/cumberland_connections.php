				"But mom, we don't want you to drive us, we want to ride our bikes."... which is music to our ears!   Landstory, as lead consultant worked directly with a transportation engineer, the Town of Cumberland and the City of Indianapolis, to develop a community-wide connectivity plan.  Guided by the towns anticipated development, future multi-use trails were identified with a special focus on the needs of the pedestrian.  Extensive public input provided unique insight into the study, which will be utilized by the town to guide future development  and make sure that all can either walk or ride a bicycle. That is of course, if they want to.  What a great country.
