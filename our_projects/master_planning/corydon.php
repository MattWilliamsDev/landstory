					History seeps out of every pore of the architectural fabric in downtown Corydon, the first state capitol of Indiana.  The Landstory planning team charged with highlighting this heritage,  identified ways to celebrate and enhance Corydon's heritage as the first state capitol.  To knit the various parts of state owned historic sites together, a plan was prepared to interconnect the existing historic sites and structures.  Not only did we look back but forward to improving the storytelling and interpretation of these important cultural elements as part of the celebration planned for the 2016 Bicentennial of Indiana.  Tell your friends, tell your neighbors, as this should make for a memorable Hoosier experience!!
