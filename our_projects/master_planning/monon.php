				Another great little Indiana town and another great story to tell.  The Town of Monon located along US 421 in north-central Indiana was the recipient of an OCRA Planning Grant in 2009.  We were able to do what we love to do; identify sound, but creative ways to bring new life and energy to their downtown.   Capitalizing on their rich railroad heritage Landstory was part of the team of consultants garnering public input, identifying infrastructure improvements, connectivity potential and design elements to provide their downtown its own unique look.  We also prepared a market assessment to identify realistic ways to attract new investment and improve quality of life integrated with that return on investment thing we do.  <br /><br />  To sum it up, Petula Clark said it best in her famous song  <em>"Downtown":  "your life is much brighter there, you can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares..."</em>.
