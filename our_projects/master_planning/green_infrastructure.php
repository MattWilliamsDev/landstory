				What city in the country is going to be considered the greenest?  Indianapolis wants the title and we stand ready to help them achieve it.  Rainwater + combined sewer overflow + the green industry = an exciting series of solutions.  Creative and aesthetic solutions were developed to mitigate surface storm water through man-made and natural elements;  bio-swales, rain gardens, rainwater collection, permeable pavement and green roofs.  The beauty of this project is that it ranges from a single residential rainbarrel, to a large regional bioretention area.  To help inform the public, Landstory developed a variety of techniques with before and after images and facts and figures for each technique.  These easy-to-read images showcase how simple it can be to preserve and enhance our most valuable water resources.
