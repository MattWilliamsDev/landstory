				Flashback: Late 19th century - Downtown Sullivan was once the vital hub of government and commerce in the region. The streets were crowded with professionals and merchants involved in the coal mining and farming industry. Flash forward: Early 21st century, the downtown revitalization plan crafted by the Landstory planning team in 2009 developed a plan to return vitality to downtown Sullivan by capitalizing on the area's vast tourism potential. The downtown plan focused on local consensus building, celebrating unique attributes and identifying realistic revitalization efforts to maximize Sullivan's return on their investment. The many unique shops and restaurants cater to visitors visiting the local state parks and recreation areas. The visitors and residents are also drawn to the many restored commercial buildings, the historic neighborhoods, groceries, drugstores and banking that continue to thrive downtown. Let's hear it for small town Indiana!! </p>
