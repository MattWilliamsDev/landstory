					Considered the south gateway to Muncie, South Madison Avenue had fallen prey to expansive commercial blight and deterioration.  Landstory prepared a concept for a 4-block area including landscape enhancements, decorative crosswalks, a spherical round-a-bout, lighting and medians. Public art will highlight the corridor through a series of large stone pedestals depicting a lotus flower, a symbol of re-birth, in various stages of blooming.  We think that's a pretty compelling story, and the State of Indiana must have thought so too, because they received a handsome portion of stimulus funds to help make it happen.
