					Did you know that half of the Town of Cumberland is in Hancock County and the other half is in Marion County? Just a bit of trivia. The design of the new streetscape developed by Landstory recognizes the most important aspect of its continuity; Old National Road (US 40).  The incorporation of a central median commemorates the placement and alignment of the original Interurban rail line.  Furnishings, lighting and signage symbolize the varied modes of transportation responsible for bringing the Town of Cumberland into existence. Now the residents can cross the street safely and "get to the other side", all while being reminded of their rich history and unique, wonderful little downtown.  The Town of Cumberland is near and dear to us and we are grateful for our decade-long relationship.
