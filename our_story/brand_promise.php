								Corydon, Vincennes and Lanier Historic Site Master Plans
							</h4>
							<blockquote>
								<p>
									"It has been a true pleasure working with Landstory... These projects were large in scope, incorporating architectural and landscape improvements, separated into phases, through a 30 year implementation period.  All were finished on time and within budget... Each staff member was professional, practical and patient... There were challenges unique to each plan... which were handled with ease.  The suggestions and concepts developed for each plan were excellent.<br/>
									<br/>
									The master plans were very well received and both communities expressed appreciation for the advanced planning.  Landstory worked very hard to incorporate our suggestions and gave us a product which we are proud to display."

									understanding of the critical balance between the engineering, Landscape Architecture and budgetary
									aspects of the project while creatively telling New Albany's story."

								University Avenue Corridor Study
							</h4>
							<blockquote>
								<p>
									"LandStory was hired to help us envision and design streetscape and landscape elements for the University Avenue Corridor Study. Working with LandStory staff was easy, and resulted in creative solutions for an older urban corridor in need of cost-effective design ideas. I appreciated their respect for the unique public and private interests along the corridor, as they took the time to develop unifying concepts that incorporated identifiable elements from each entity. The implementation of their concepts will help play a major role in attracting future investment to the corridor."
