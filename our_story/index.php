				<dt>The beginning of <br/>
					our story:</dt>
				<dd class="first">
					<p>Landstory, formerly known as CBA (Claire Bennett Associates), has been
						committed to the preservation and enhancement of our natural environment
						since the firm's beginning in l974. Under the leadership of Harvard educated
						Claire Bennett, FASLA, the firm flourished as a small practice with a focus
						on large, estate residential design and commercial landscape architecture
						design.  It afforded Bennett the opportunity to balance her time between
						two passions; the field of  Landscape Architecture and her family.   Under this auspice, Joann Green, resigned from her position
						as Director of Landscape Architecture  for the Indianapolis office of HNTB in 1992,
						 and joined Bennett as a partner and vice-president.   To compliment Bennett's
						background and experience, Joann brought extensive larger scale design  and
						technical and management experience gained from 16 previous years of professional
						practice working for architecture and engineering firms. She became sole
						owner of CBA in 1997 upon Bennett's retirement and since then has led the
						CBA team to provide outstanding, award-winning design and exemplary customer
						service. The breadth of the firm's Landscape Architecture expertise extends
						to the following areas:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Site Design</li>
						<li>Trails &amp; Greenways</li>
						<li>Parks &amp; Recreation</li>
						<li>Corridors &amp; Streetscapes</li>
						<li>Master Planning</li>
						<li>Grant writing</li>
					</ul>
